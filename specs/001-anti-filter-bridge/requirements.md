# Anti-Filter Bridge - Requirements

## Functional Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. **Secure Tunnel Establishment**
   - Establish secure WebSocket connections between client and server
   - Support multiple concurrent connections
   - Automatic reconnection on connection loss

2. **Proxy Support**
   - SOCKS5 proxy server implementation
   - Support for both TCP and UDP traffic
   - DNS resolution through the tunnel

3. **Authentication**
   - Token-based authentication
   - Support for multiple users with different access levels
   - Rate limiting to prevent abuse

4. **Monitoring**
   - Real-time connection statistics
   - Bandwidth usage monitoring
   - Connection logs

### User Interface
1. **Command Line Interface**
   - Start/stop server/client
   - Configuration management
   - Status monitoring

2. **Web Interface**
   - Dashboard for monitoring connections
   - Configuration management
   - Real-time statistics

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
1. **Latency**
   - Maximum additional latency: < 100ms
   - Connection establishment time: < 2 seconds

2. **Throughput**
   - Minimum throughput: 10 Mbps per connection
   - Support for at least 1000 concurrent connections

3. **Resource Usage**
   - Maximum memory usage: 100MB per connection
   - CPU usage under 70% at maximum load

### Security
1. **Encryption**
   - TLS 1.3 for all communications
   - Strong cipher suites only
   - Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) support

2. **Authentication**
   - Secure token storage
   - Token rotation
   - Revocation of compromised tokens

3. **Privacy**
   - No logging of user traffic
   - Minimal metadata retention
   - Clear data retention policy

### Reliability
1. **Availability**
   - 99.9% uptime
   - Graceful degradation under load

2. **Recovery**
   - Automatic recovery from failures
   - State synchronization after reconnection
   - Data integrity verification
